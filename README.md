# CyberSecurity
This repository is a collection of my beginner-level cybersecurity learning resources, notes, and practice exercises. It includes simple examples, small scripts, and documentation covering fundamental topics like network security basics, common web vulnerabilities (such as the OWASP Top 10), Linux security commands, and secure coding best practices. The goal of this project is to help me document my learning journey in cybersecurity while also sharing useful, easy-to-understand material for other beginners who are interested in starting their own path in this field.
