# CyberSecurity
<h1> Hi, I am Nirali</h1>

A technology professional currently advancing my expertise in cybersecurity.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of foundational cybersecurity notes, practical exercises, and scripts that I have developed while studying key topics such as network security principles, OWASP Top 10 web vulnerabilities, Linux security command-line tools, password cracking methodologies, and secure coding practices. The purpose of this project is to systematically document my learning progression and to provide well-structured, accessible resources that can assist other individuals beginning their journey in the field of cybersecurity.
